#### MEV - Maximal Extractable Value / Miner Extractable Value:


- [Quantifying Blockchain Extractable Value: How dark is the forest?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05511v2.pdf) - Authors provide evidence that miners already extract Miner Extractable Value (MEV), which could destabilize the blockchain consensus security, as related work has shown.

- [Flash Boys 2.0: Frontrunning, Transaction Reordering, and Consensus Instability in Decentralized Exchanges](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf) - Introduces the concept of MEV, the work highlights the large, complex risks created by transaction-ordering dependencies in smart contracts and the ways in which traditional forms of financial-market exploitation are adapting to and penetrating blockchain economies.

- [Flashbots: MEV in Eth2](https://hackmd.io/@flashbots/mev-in-eth2) - In this post, authors study transaction ordering in eth2 and analyze MEV-enabled staking yields. Then they find that MEV will significantly boost validator rewards but may reinforce inequalities among participants of eth2. Authors also discuss qualitative aspects of MEV in eth2 such as the potential dynamics that will unfold between its largest stakeholders like exchanges and validator pools.
